# Code Challenge C

Suppose you find this code, created by an overeager sales person who has tried their hand at creating a ‘feature’ they want implemented. There are two tasks you have:
 
1. Please review the code so that you can teach the sales agent how to improve their development skills. You can do inline comments in the exiting code, or a separate write-up, whatever makes more sense or is easier for you.
2. Fix the feature and send back.
